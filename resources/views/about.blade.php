                        <p>Dastangoi, the lost art of storytelling, developed around the stories of valour and adventures of an Arab hero â€“ Amir Hamza, in 8th century AD. Soon, these stories spread out and the tradition could be found right from Bosnia, Morocco, Algeria to Indonesia and China. However, these stories became very popular when they entered the Urdu canon and the art form as known to us reached its zenith in the 19th century North India. With the demise of Mir Baqar Ali, the last known exponent of the art form, in 1928, the form also died with him. The modern revival is an effort of two gentlemen, SR Faruqi, the noted Urdu litterateur, and Mahmood Farooqui, who conceived the modern format of the art form. The first Dastangoi show in modern era happened in May 2005. Since then, the art form has grown with a team of dastangos that has staged more than 1000 shows across the world. We have also expanded our repertoire of stories. Besides the traditional Dastan-e-Amir Hamza stories, we have added new content too.</p>
